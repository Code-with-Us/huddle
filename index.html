				<h3>
					Grow Together
				</h3>
				<p>
					Generate meaningful discussions with your audience and build a strong, loyal community. Think of the insightful conversations you miss out on with a feedback form.
				</p>
				
			<h3>
				Flowing Conversations
			</h3>
			<p>
				You wouldn't paginate a conversation in real life, so why do it online? Our threads have just-in-time loading for a more natural flow.
			</p>
		
			<h3>
				Your Users
			</h3>
			<p>
				It takes no time at all to integrate Huddle with your app's authentication solution. This means, once signed in to your app, your users can start chatting immediately.
